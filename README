JTalk is a XMPP chat client written in Javascript.

It provides basic chat functionality (roster retrieval, subscription handling)
and a very basic, customizable user interface.

Some aspects of JTalk's behavior are governed by hooks, to which handlers can be
attached. Here is a list of currently supported hooks:

"new chat": Triggered when a chat window is first opened.
The handler receives a chat object and is expected to return a Boolean.
If the return value is false, the new window is simply appended to
document.body. Otherwise, no action is taken.

"new message": Triggered when a new message is received in a chat window.
The handler receives an object whose 'chat' attribute is a chat object, and
whose 'text' attribute is the text of the message. The return value is ignored.

"new chat state": Triggered when a new chat state (e.g. composing) is received.
The handler receives an object whose 'chat' attribute is a chat object, and
whose 'chatstate' attribute is the chat state received. The return value is
ignored.

"subscription request": Triggered when a subscription request is received. The
handler receives the jid of the user that originated the subscription. The
return value is currently ignored.

"chat requested": Triggered when the user requests a chat with a contact (i.e.,
by clicking on the contact's entry in the roster), regardless of whether a new
chat is initiated or not. The handler receives a chat object and its return
value is ignored.
